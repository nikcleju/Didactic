These topics can be modified and adjusted at will. Any other similar topic is possible, after a discussion with me. Applications in signal processing: image / video / audio / etc. Embedded devices for acquisition of signals Any topic that the student is interested in , in the domain of signal processing. Talk to me about it first. Requirements for students Students should have: abilities and interest in programming: Matlab / Python / any other language general knowledge in Digital Signal Processing and related domain Topics General Machine Learning algorithms Outlier detection in network data using Python Use algorithms for anomaly detection from the Python PyOD library to detect attacks from network traffic (e.g. detect network attacks, which are different from normal traffic data) Reference: https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ also see the tutorials / examples there Dataset: https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset Failure detection in industrial systems Use algorithms for anomaly detection from the Python PyOD library to detect failures in industrial devices, like ball bearings, based on accelerometer data.

PyOD: https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ AI and neural networks Parking Spotter Use object detection methods for detecting cars and free parking spots in a large parking area. Implement it live on a Raspberry PI or equivalent. Example: https://www.parking-spotter.com/ Car Distance Estimator Use object detection methods for detecting the car in front of you and, based on the size of the car, estimate the distance to it. Implement it live on a Raspberry PI or equivalent. People Counter Implement an application to detect and count people from images/videos and report long-term statistics Image/video processing Lane detection Use image processing algorithms to detect the lanes from a traffic video and understand: which lane we are currently on is there a curve next, or is the road straight Implement it live on a Raspberry PI or equivalent. Example: https://medium.com/computer-car/udacity-self-driving-car-nanodegree-project-1-finding-lane-lines-9cd6a846c58c Image inpainting using sparse representations Image inpainting means \u201efilling\u201d some missing pixels or parts of an image. Implement one of the various methods for this, namely the one based on sparse decompositions of images in the frequency domain. References: https://github.com/ily-R/Image-Inpainting-via-Sparse-Representation Image classification with SVM (or other) algorithms Implement and evaluate an algorithm for image classification, aiming to detect if a person is or is not wearing a mask. References: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9301079 Methods for image denoising Implement and compare a number of methods for reducing the noise in general images or other types of data (based on filtering, different transforms, spline smoothing etc).
